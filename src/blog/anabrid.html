    The [anabrid news](https://anabrid.com/news) is a blog-like information website about
    my company [anabrid](/companies/#anabrid). In the past, all entries were written by me. Since
    there was a CMS transition in 2024, the feed and most links are broken. There is a successor
    feed at [anabrid apex](https://anabrid.dev/about/news/) which is however not well alive.
    The best option for company news is the [anabrid feed at Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/anabrid/).
