  <h1>Freelancing</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    I am an experienced software engineer for <a href="#tech">all architectures
    and platforms</a>, from hardware-affine embedded to frontend.
    I frequently work on <a href="#roles">roles at senior or team lead level</a>.
    I run <a href="#teach">workshops and trainings</a>.
    I consider myself a <a href="https://merki.ca/blog/what-is-a-wildcard-person">wildcard person</a>.
    <!--I am often refered to as the "universal weapon for any kind of task".-->
  </p>
  
  <p>My primary areas of work are big data, platform architectures and working
  on problems that have been impossible to solve with computers until now. My
  expertise is a <a href="/research">PhD in computational physics</a> and more then
  20 years of professional experience in sofware engineering.
  
  Over the years, I have taken on various roles, including
     developer,
     team lead,
     architect,
     analyst,
     product owner,
     buisness advisor,
     <a href="/companies">founder</a>,
     chief information officer,
     supervisory board member and
     managing director.
    
  
  <h2 id="tech">Technologies</h2>
  <p>Handy-on experience in programming ecosystems and environments, sorted by
     descending preference:
    
  {% for tech in technologies %}
  <p><strong>{{ tech.title }}</strong> <em>({{ tech.experience }})</em>
  <p>{% for keyword in tech.technologies %}{{ keyword }}{% if forloop.last == false %}&nbsp;‧ {% endif %}{%endfor%}
  {% if tech.highlight %}
  <em> ‧ Highlight: {{ tech.highlight }}</em>
  {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  
  <h2 id="teach">Training and Workshops</h2>
  
  <p>I love teaching and passing knowledge in a dense and useful form. I used to work
  in university didactics / higher education paedagogy for 10 years at Goethe University,
  Frankfurt at stations such as the 
  <a href="https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/131356377/">Interdisciplinary Center
  for university teaching and learning</a>, <a href="https://www.studiumdigitale.uni-frankfurt.de/">Studiumdigitale</a>
  and my own institution for medialisation and outreach of natural sciences, called
  <em>PhysikOnline</em>. At Between 2009 and 2019, I raised more then 500kEUR for
  running teams dedicated to creating content, videos and digital tools. We had several offices
  and operated own student computer center. Here's a bit of
  <a href="https://svenk.org/~koeppel/elearning/">project description</a>.</p>
  
  
  <!--
  <h2>A few Principles</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>I always aim to speak the language of my audience. This principle shapes everything
        I create — from presentations and documentation to code.

    <li>I view tooling as a social contract. While tools like Kubernetes, NPM, or Golang
        may not be perfect on their own, their widespread adoption fosters shared context.
        Effective collaboration often depends on speaking a common technical language.

    <li>I'm a strong advocate for Open Source, including in industrial contexts. My daily
        tools are primarily open source: LibreOffice, LaTeX, and Linux desktops, among
        others. I choose them for their portability, accessibility, and scriptability —
        all of which contribute to efficiency. Still, I'm pragmatic and use closed-source
        tools when they make sense.

    <li>I value transparency and documentation. My written materials are thorough and
        complement — rather than duplicate — the available machine-readable formats.

    <li>I don't adopt trends blindly. For instance, my git commits <a
        href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org">are not always machine-readable</a>,
        but they leave a meaningful trail for human readers. Similarly, I believe <a
        href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> often introduces unnecessary
        complexity by embedding meaning into version numbers.

    <li>The less code, the better. The fewer dependencies, the better. For technical
        audiences, software can be elegant and expressive. For industry, it often serves
        as a necessary layer for formalizing collaboration.

    <li>AI has its place in enhancing my effectiveness without compromising data
        security. I clearly declare when I use it — and yes, even this list was improved
        with the help of ChatGPT and similar tools through prompts like "improve the
        formulation"
  </ul>
  -->

  <h2 id="roles">Roles and clients</h2>

  <p>
    I successfully leads heterogenous teams of hardware and software
    engineers since many years. I also has half a decade of experience in company
    building and management. My clients range from financial auditing over tech
    companies to research institutes.
  
  <p>
    I frequently organize my work via the <a href="https://denktmit.de/">DenktMit eG</a>
    (<a href="https://denktmit.de/team/dr-sven-koeppel/">my profile at DenktMit</a>)
    but I am also available as self-employed independent freelancer.
    My <em>Freelancing CV</em> contains a listing of selected projects is available on request.
