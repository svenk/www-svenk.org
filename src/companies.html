  <h1>Entrepreneurship</h1>
  
  <p class="lead">
    In 2020 I turned my hobby into a profession and started fulltime into
    freelancing and entrepreneurship. I founded and run the following
    German-based associations and companies.
  </p>

  <h2 id="anabrid">Anabrid <abbr title="Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung">GmbH</abbr></h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.anabrid.com">Anabrid</a> is a deep tech startup
     all about bringing analog computing technology on a CMOS microchip.
     We want to catch up decades lost of advances in integration
     in general purpose analog electronics. As an intermediate steps, we also
     develop large-scale discrete analog computers and custom chips. For anabrid,
     knowledge transfer and open source are very important. In 2021, we developed
     <a href="https://the-analog-thing.org/">the educational computer
     »The Analog Thing«</a>, which gained quite some public attention.
     
  <p>I cofounded the company with three fellows in July 2020. As the
     <em>Chief Scientific Officer (CSO)</em>, I am part of the executive board.
     My thematic priority is digging into various scientific problems and mapping
     them on analog computers.
     The company has about 20 employees and runs a research facility in Ulm,
     Southern Germany. The main lab
     is in Frankfurt and the administrative office in Berlin.
     
  <h2 id="denktmit">DenktMit <abbr title="eingetragene Genossenschaft">eG</abbr></h2>
  <p><a href="https://denktmit.de/">DenktMit</a> is a consulting
     cooperation specialized on difficult IT projects. I cofounded the company
     with a nine other partners in May 2021. An obvious difference to other
     companies is its organization form as a cooperative society (association,
     <em>Genossenschaft</em> in German),
     which has similiarities to the structures of foundations and associations.
     We chose this structure in order to establish a democratic company which
     cannot be bought up by principle. In 2023 the coop grew up to more then
     19 members all over Germany.
     
  <p>The company is remote-first but operates
     a decent-sized office in Oberursel, close to Frankfurt, Germany.
