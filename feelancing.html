  <h1>Freelancing</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    I am an experienced programmer and system architect for all architectures
    and platforms, from hardware-affine embedded to frontend. I am a
    scientist by heart and am often refered
    to as "universal weapon for any kind of problem".
  </p>
  
  <h2>Technologies</h2>
  <p>Programming ecosystems and environments I regularly work in (sorted by
     descending preference):
  <ul>
  {% for tech in page.technologies %}
    <li><strong>{{ tech.title }}</strong>: {{ tech.technologies }}
        <em>({{ tech.experience }})</em>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Roles and clients</h2>
  <p>I regularly work in the following roles:
     Lead development / Team lead,
     Software architect and developer,
     frontend developer,
     data engineer and data analyst.
  
  <p>
    I successfully leads heterogenous teams of hardware and software
    engineers since many years. I also has half a decade of experience in company
    building and management. My clients range from financial auditing over tech
    companies to research institutes.
    My Freelancing CV contains a listing of selected projects in various domains
    and is available on request.
