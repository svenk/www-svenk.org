  <h1>Entrepreneurship</h1>
  
  <p class="lead">
    In 2020 I turned my hobby into a profession and started fulltime into
    freelancing and entrepreneurship. I founded and run the following
    German-based associations and companies.
  </p>

  <h2>Anabrid <abbr title="Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung">GmbH</abbr></h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.anabrid.com">Anabrid</a> is a deep tech startup
     all about bringing analog computing technology on a CMOS microchip.
     We want to catch up decades lost of advances in integration
     in general purpose analog electronics. As an intermediate steps, we also
     develop large-scale discrete analog computers and custom chips. For anabrid,
     knowledge transfer and open source are very important. In 2021, we developed
     <a href="https://the-analog-thing.org/">the educational computer
     »The Analog Thing«</a>, which gained quite some public attention.
     
  <p>I cofounded the company with three fellows in July 2020. As the
     <em>Chief Scientific Officer (CSO)</em>, I am part of the executive board.
     My thematic priority is digging into various scientific problems and mapping
     them on analog computers.     
     The company is currently fully remote, with an administrative office
     in Berlin, Germany.
     
  <h2>DenktMit <abbr title="eingetragene Genossenschaft">eG</abbr></h2>
  <p><a href="https://denktmit.de/">DenktMit</a> is a consulting
     cooperation specialized on difficult IT projects. I cofounded the company
     with a nine other partners in May 2021. An obvious difference to other
     companies is its organization form as a cooperative society (association),
     which has similiarities to the structures of foundations and associations.
     We chose this structure in order to establish a democratic company which
     cannot be bought up by principle.
     
  <p>The company is remote-first but operates
     a decent-sized office in Oberursel, close to Frankfurt, Germany.
     I'm currently not carrying out a position in the managament board, but
     I have a <a href="https://denktmit.de/genossen/sven-koeppel.html">skills
     profile at our website</a>. If you want to book me or my team
     as a freelancer, you can <a href="https://denktmit.de/impressum.html">drop
     us a message</a>.

  <h2 id="technikum29">technikum29 Computer museum (<abbr title="eingetragener Verein">eV</abbr> <abbr title="in Gründung">iG</abbr>)</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://technikum29.de">technikum</a> is a private
     museum for computer and communication history.
     Within the hobbyist vintage computing community, it takes a distinct
     position thanks to its one-of-a-kind dedicated building, allowing it to
     offer a home to extremely heavy vintage computers such as vacuum-tube computers,
     punch card systems and mainframes. Since 2019, together with a small team of
     highly motivated volunteers, we shape this
     <a href="https://technikum29.de/blog/2019-02-04-the-heritage">heritage</a>.
  <p>
     The museum is located near Frankfurt, Germany.
     Legally, the museum is currently operated in a private fashion
     (yet not for profit)
     but plans exist for rolling out a registered non-profit association
     (similar to a NGO).
