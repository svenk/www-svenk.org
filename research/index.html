  <h2>Sven Köppel: Research</h2>

  <p>I am a theoretical physicist with a background in applied mathematics,
     mathematical physics and computer science. My current research
     focus is on exotic computing approaches, such as 
     <a href="#analog">analog computing</a>, quantum computing or
     neuromorphic architectures.

  <p>I graduated with a PhD thesis on
     <a href="../publications/Thesis/phdthesis-Sven-Koeppel.pdf">numerical and quantum
     general relativity</a> at <a href="https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/">Goethe-Universität Frankfurt</a>
     in 2019. A major research interest during my studies was
     <a href="../publications/Thesis/Sven-Koeppel-master-thesis-Ultraviolet-improved-black-holes.pdf">exotic
     high energy physics</a> and quantum field theory. On the field of
     applied mathematics, I studied advanced numerical methods for partial
     differential equations. I worked on exascale methods for
     solving hyperbolic equations
     within the European <a href="https://exahype.eu/">ExaHyPE</a> project.

<!-- Since April 2020 I work on a German-based research and engineering
     project to explore analog computing to accelerate the most challenging
     problems in computing, such as simulation of quantum computers,
     machine learning and artificial intelligence. -->

  <h3 id="analog">Analog computing</h3>
  <p>Analog computing is a rediscovered branch of science which was beaten
  by digital (i.e. algorithmic/numeric) computing in the 1980s. In the dawn
  of Moore's law, this branch of classical computing percieves a revival.
  Based on the experience of programmable hardware (FPGAs), it is tangible
  to build large analog circuits to solve differential equations in a
  time- and energy-efficient way beyond digital computing. I am part of 
  a German-based team which tries to develop a prototypical analog computer
  on a chip within the next few years.
  
  <p>There is a rich scientific landscape waiting to be discovered all around
  this exotic branch of computer science and intersection between electrical
  engineering, computational science and applied mathematics.
  Many concepts of numerical mathematics can be transfered and connections to
  other contemporary attempts to computing, namely quantum computing and
  artificial intelligence, are all along the way. It is an exciting time
  where analog circuits can make a radical difference in the computational
  accessibility of the largest problems in the world.
  
  <p>Here are a few recent publications in the context of analog computing:

  <ul>
    <li>Köppel, Ulmann, Heimann, Killat:
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07268">Using analog computers in today's largest computational challenges</a>,
        to be published in a Special Issue of the open-access journal "Advances in Radio Science",
        February 2021,
        preprint at <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07268">arXiv:2102.07268</a>

  </ul>

  <h3>Reference material about analog computing</h3>
  <p>Note: I am conducting research on analog computing since half a year
  and a couple of publications are in the pipeline. In the meantime, see
  for instance these publications:
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07327-2">A continuous-time MaxSAT solver with high analog performance</a>
        (Molnár+2018, Nature Communications).
    <li><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49699-5">Analog Coupled Oscillator Based Weighted Ising Machine</a>
        (Chou+2019, Nature Scientific Reports on <a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/hfddcbgbea">Novel
         hardware and concepts for unconvential computing</a>).

  </ul>

  <p>(Note to myself: We have more then 300 papers compiled on analog computing
  in all kind of scientific branches and will put a literature database online
  soon)
