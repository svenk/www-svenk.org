  description: >
    The *uniordner* (meaning *university folder*) was a huge and well-maintained repository during my
    study times between 2010 and 2018. This was well-engineered on a NAS and with mod_perl, a
    sophisticated but minimalistic access control system. Some infrastructure is still available at
    [svenk/uniordner at github](https://github.com/svenk/uniordner), but the files are not.
    This used to be hosted at [https://sven.köppel.org](sven.köppel.org).
    Hopefully there is still a copy so this can be properly released one day. Up to then,
    all links are broken.
